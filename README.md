Tyrannosaurus Text offers a quick fix to make your html words mono-width to give text a solid blocky appearance.

# Usage

## HTML 

In the &lt;head&gt; tag, link to the style sheet and the js code. 
Then in the &lt;body&gt; all you have to do is write the text you need in the &lt;div&gt; you want to have mono-width text. You can also use an underscore in between words to keep them on the same line.

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="tyrannosaurusText.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="tyrannosaurusText.css">

<div class="class-name">TYRANNOSAURUS TEXT</div> 
<div class="class-name">SEVENTY MILLION YEARS_AGO</div>
```

## JS
In the &lt;script&gt; tag or .js file you are using, all you have to do is call tText() and pass it the class name of the text you want to modify and width you want the text to be.

```
new tText("class-name",width).set();
```

After that tyrannosaurusText will make lines of text the width you specified.

## CSS (optional)

Then, so you can choose to clean things up, tyrannosaurusText will automatically name your text blocks with ids `TyrannosaurusText-#` for each block of text, and `Saurus-#` for each line. If you chose to, subtract pixels until you find the gap in between each line that you want.

```
#TyrannosaurusText-# { top: #-px; }
#Saurus-# { top: #-px; }
```
